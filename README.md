# About this repository
This repository contains my .nanorc file for the FreeBASIC programming language. A .nanorc file tells the text editor Nano how to highlight the syntax of a .bas file. [GNU Nano](http://www.nano-editor.org/) is a simple text editor that can be used inside a *nix type terminal. AFAIK a FreeBASIC hightlighting scheme did not exist yet.
